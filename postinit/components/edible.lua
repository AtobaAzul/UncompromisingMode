Characters can have three types of food affinity: Prefab Affinity, Tag Affinity, and Foodtype Affinity
Prefab Affinity is specifying a prefab to give bonus hunger (e.g. Bacon and Eggs for Wilson)
Tag Affinity is specifying all foods with a certain tag to give bonus hunger (not used in base game)
Foodtype Affinity is specifying all foods of a certain type to give bonus hunger (e.g. veggies for Wurt)

It is assumed that any prefab affinity is considered a character's favorite food, and thus will be
converted into bonus sanity, but not tag affinity or foodtype affinity (if foodtype affinity was included,
Wurt would gain sanity from eating any vegetable!). If you want to specify a character to have all
foods of a certain tag or foodtype to be their favorite foods, please use the favorite_food_fn function
in the foodaffinity component.

Please refer to postinit/components/foodaffinity for related changes and further documentation
regarding characters' favorite foods.

DoFoodEffects in postinit/components/eater was modified to check for favorite foods.
