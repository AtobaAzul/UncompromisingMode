<h1>5. Working with Instruments</h1>
<p>FMOD Studio uses the term <a href="glossary.html#instrument">instrument</a> to describe the variety of trigger regions that can be included in an <a href="glossary.html#event">event</a>.</p>
<p>Instruments can be inserted into an event's <a href="glossary.html#audio-track">audio track</a> or onto a <a href="glossary.html#game-parameter">game parameter</a> and are triggered by the <a href="glossary.html#playback-position">playback position</a> overlapping the instrument. Once triggered, that instrument will play the audio, event, or <a href="glossary.html#snapshot">snapshot</a> associated with it.</p>
<h2 id="instrument-types"><a href="#instrument-types">5.1 Instrument Types</a></h2>
<p>There are several instrument types available for FMOD Studio.</p>
<h3 id="single-instruments"><a href="#single-instruments">5.1.1 Single Instruments</a></h3>
<p>Single instruments are the simplest form of instruments in FMOD Studio. When triggered they play a single audio file.</p>
<p>To create single instruments, either right click on an event <a href="glossary.html#audio-track">audio track</a> and select "Add Single Instrument," or drag an <a href="glossary.html#audio-file">audio file</a> to the audio track from the <a href="glossary.html#assets-browser">assets browser</a> or a <a href="glossary.html#file-manager">file manager</a> application.</p>
<h3 id="multi-instruments"><a href="#multi-instruments">5.1.2 Multi Instruments</a></h3>
<p>Multi instruments contain <a href="glossary.html#playlist">playlists</a> of single instruments, programmer instruments, and/or event instruments. When triggered they can be played in order of top to bottom or in a random sequence. The playlist is set to random by default and this is the recommended behavior.</p>
<p>Multi instruments are good for variations of the same sound to make the game world more immersive, such as multiple footstep sounds for walking animations.</p>
<p>To create multi instruments, either right click on an event's <a href="glossary.html#audio-track">audio track</a> and select "Add Multi Instrument," or drag a multi-selection of audio files to the audio track from the assets browser or a file manager application.</p>
<h3 id="event-instruments"><a href="#event-instruments">5.1.3 Event Instruments</a></h3>
<p>Event instruments are instruments that play the output of a <a href="glossary.html#event-reference-instrument">referenced event</a>. </p>
<p>The events being referenced can have their outputs altered by game parameters on both the actual event it was created in and the event it is referenced in. If the <a href="glossary.html#parameter">game parameter</a> on the referenced event matches the name and value range of the game parameter on the event it is referenced in, these are then linked. Altering the values or on the event instrument will also alter the values in the referenced event.</p>
<p>Event instruments are good for when you need more control over the sound produced compared to a standard instrument.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of event instruments - <a href="organizing-the-project.html#referenced-events">referenced events</a> and <a href="organizing-the-project.html#nested-events">nested events</a>. Referenced events are normal events, containing their own mixer bus, and can be referenced in any other events. A nested event can only be referenced by its parent event but as many times as you need, and does not have its own mixer bus. Instead, it will inherit all settings from its parents mixer bus.</p>
<p>To create a referenced event instrument, drag an event from the <a href="glossary.html#events-browser">events browser</a> onto an audio track. To create a nested event, right click on an event's <a href="glossary.html#audio-track">audio track</a> and select "Add Event Instrument".</p>
<h3 id="scatterer-instruments"><a href="#scatterer-instruments">5.1.4 Scatterer Instruments</a></h3>
<p>Scatterer instruments are a special type of instrument that continuously spawn instances of the 2D or 3D instruments in their playlists.</p>
<p>When placed onto an <a href="glossary.html#audio-track">audio track</a> each instrument played from the playlist has its own spatializer attached that allows its location to be randomized, even when the scatterer instrument is placed in a 2D event. If, however, the scatterer instrument's playlist contains 2D <span class="dead-link" href="instrument-reference.html#event-instrument">event instruments</span class="dead-link">) then those event instrument's output will be in 2D.</p>
<p>Scatterer instruments are perfect for creating ambiance, such as having crickets chirping inside a field.</p>
<p>To create a scatterer instrument, right click on an event's <a href="glossary.html#audio-track">audio track</a> and select "Add Scatterer Instrument".</p>
<h3 id="programmer-instruments"><a href="#programmer-instruments">5.1.5 Programmer Instruments</a></h3>
<p>Programmer instruments are a type of empty instrument that generates callbacks. These callbacks are then used to play any audio file the programmer chooses - whether it's a part of the FMOD Studio project or not.</p>
<p>Programmer instruments are perfect for games with a lot of dialogue and localization, especially when combined with <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#audio-table">audio tables</span class="dead-link">.</p>
<p>To create a programmer instrument, right click on an event's <a href="glossary.html#audio-track">audio track</a> and select "Add Programmer Instrument".</p>
<h3 id="plug-in-instruments"><a href="#plug-in-instruments">5.1.6 Plug-in Instruments</a></h3>
<p>Plug-in instruments are a type of instrument that can produce any kind of custom sound you may need.</p>
<p>For example you may need a specific type of synthesizer, a procedurally generated audio instrument, or even a tracker file playback instrument.</p>
<p>To create a plug-in instrument, right click on an event's <a href="glossary.html#audio-track">audio track</a> and select a plug-in from one of the sub-menus in "Add Plug-in Instrument".</p>
<p>By default, FMOD Studio is bundled with trial versions of AudioGaming's AudioWeather and AudioMotors plug-ins.</p>
<p>You are free to develop your own plug-in instruments. For more information on how to do this, please see the <a href="https://www.fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?page=content/generated/overview/plugin_api_dsp.html#/">FMOD Studio API documentation</a>.</p>
<h3 id="snapshot-instruments"><a href="#snapshot-instruments">5.1.7 Snapshot Instruments</a></h3>
<p>Snapshot instruments are a type of <span class="dead-link" href="instrument-reference.html#event-instrument">event instruments</span class="dead-link">. While a snapshot instrument is triggered, the snapshot starts and the properties scoped into it are applied.</p>
<p>These properties take the form of volume faders and effect dials. If any of these are adjusted in a snapshot, they are applied while the snapshot is triggered. For more information, see the <a href="mixing.html#snapshots-and-the-tracks-view">snapshots and the tracks view</a> section of the <a href="mixing.html">mixing</a> chapter.</p>
<p>Snapshots are perfect for creating reverb zones in your game.</p>
<p>Once the <a href="glossary.html#playback-position">playback position</a> leaves the instrument, the snapshot is stopped and the applied parameters are reverted.</p>
<h2 id="synchronous-and-asynchronous-instruments"><a href="#synchronous-and-asynchronous-instruments">5.2 Synchronous and Asynchronous Instruments</a></h2>
<p>When triggering instruments to play, you may need them to behave slightly different depending on the situation. You might need an instrument to have fixed playback times to seek within its content, or you may need an instrument to play the entirety of the selected asset when triggered, regardless of the length of the instrument.</p>
<p>FMOD Studio allows you to set instruments to either <a href="glossary.html#synchronous">synchronous</a> or <a href="glossary.html#asynchronous">asynchronous</a> mode.</p>
<p>In the sound, <a href="glossary.html#playlist">playlist</a>, or <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#placeholder">placeholder</span class="dead-link"> area of the instrument's <a href="glossary.html#deck">deck</a>, click on the "Async" button to toggle asynchronous playback on or off. If the button is yellow, it is on, otherwise it is off. Please note that if an instrument cannot change its synchronous state, the "Async" button will be missing.</p>
<p><img alt="Async Button" src="images/asynchronousButton.png" /></p>
<p>Please note that any instrument placed in a <a href="glossary.html#game-parameter">game parameter</a> will always be asynchronous.</p>
<p>These are the default states of each instrument in FMOD Studio:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#single-instruments">Single Instruments</a></strong>: Synchronous</li>
<li><strong><a href="#multi-instruments">Multi Instruments</a></strong>: Synchronous</li>
<li><strong><a href="#event-instruments">Event Instruments</a></strong>: Asynchronous, cannot be changed</li>
<li><strong><a href="#scatterer-instruments">Scatterer Instruments</a></strong>: Asynchronous, cannot be changed</li>
<li><strong><a href="#programmer-instruments">Programmer Instruments</a></strong>: Synchronous</li>
<li><strong><a href="#plug-in-instruments">Plug-in Instruments</a></strong>: Special instrument. Plug-in instruments can be set to either synchronous or asynchronous depending on how they were designed</li>
<li><strong><a href="#snapshot-instruments">Snapshot Instruments</a></strong>: Special instrument. Snapshots do not produce audio but apply effect properties to events bused into it. Due to this, snapshot instruments cannot be synchronous or asynchronous</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="synchronous-instruments"><a href="#synchronous-instruments">5.2.1 Synchronous Instruments</a></h3>
<p>In synchronous mode, an instrument's length determines how long its <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#asset">assets(s)</span class="dead-link"> plays for.</p>
<p>If the instrument's length is shorter than that of the asset being played, it will stop producing audio once the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#playback-cursor">playback cursor</span class="dead-link"> leaves the <a href="glossary.html#trigger-region">trigger region</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="glossary.html#loop-playback-mode">loop mode</a> of an instrument is a way of making it repeat its content. If the instrument is set to loop, it will replay its content for the length of the instrument. By default, no instruments are set to loop. Instruments created through dragging assets onto an audio track will match the length of that asset or the longest asset in that multi-selection.</p>
<p>In synchronous mode, the part of the waveform that plays is the part of the waveform that's overlapped by the playback position. This allows you to seek (or scrub) within an <a href="glossary.html#audio-file">audio file</a> instead of always starting to play from the beginning.</p>
<p>You can trim the beginning and end of an instrument to state when it should start and finish by clicking and dragging either end of the instrument to the left or right.</p>
<p><img alt="Trimming instruments" src="images/trim.png" /></p>
<p>If you use a <a href="glossary.html#transition-marker">transition marker</a> to move to the middle of an instrument set to synchronous mode, FMOD Studio will play back audio from that point in the asset.</p>
<p>Synchronous mode is useful for transitioning around tracks in dynamic music.</p>
<p>Please note that synchronous instruments only play out the release period of an <a href="glossary.html#ahdsr-modulator">AHDSR modulator</a> if they're untriggered as a result of a <a href="glossary.html#parameter-condition">parameter condition</a>, and not if they're untriggered by the playback position leaving the trigger region.</p>
<h3 id="asynchronous-instruments"><a href="#asynchronous-instruments">5.2.2 Asynchronous Instruments</a></h3>
<p>Asynchronous mode is used for when you need assets to play in their entirety once triggered. Asynchronous instruments act like on/off switches - once the playback position has entered any part of the <a href="glossary.html#trigger-region">trigger region</a> the asset associated with that instrument will start playing from the beginning.</p>
<p>Asynchronous instruments are more useful than synchronous instruments in most situations where you don't need to seek within an audio file. They're more flexible with timeline <a href="glossary.html#transition-marker">transition markers</a> and <a href="glossary.html#transition-region">transition regions</a>, they work better with modulators, and the decoupling of timeline position and the waveform means they often work much better when using instrument <a href="glossary.html#parameter-condition">parameter conditions</a>. This is because when the parameter conditions are met, asynchronous instruments will start playing from the beginning of the waveform. By comparison, synchronous instruments will start playing the waveform from where the playback position <em>is</em> once the trigger conditions are met, which is not always desirable.</p>
<p>An asynchronous instrument <em>will</em> play out the release period of an <a href="glossary.html#ahdsr-modulator">AHDSR modulator</a> if it is untriggered by the playback position leaving the trigger region. Since this is the most common way for an instrument to be untriggered, using asynchronous instruments is very useful when considering modulators.</p>
<h2 id="looping-instruments"><a href="#looping-instruments">5.3 Looping Instruments</a></h2>
<p><a href="glossary.html#instrument">Instruments</a> may be set to loop, so that they don't stop immediately after playing a single <a href="glossary.html#audio-file">audio file</a> or <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#playlist-entry">playlist entry</span class="dead-link">. To make an instrument loop, select the instrument in the editor, then click on its <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#loop-instrument-toggle-button">loop instrument</span class="dead-link"> or <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#loop-playlist-toggle-button">loop playlist</span class="dead-link"> toggle button in the deck. </p>
<p>The loop playlist toggle button is only found on multi instruments, and appears in the <a href="glossary.html#deck">deck</a> when a <a href="glossary.html#multi-instrument">multi instrument</a> is selected in the <a href="glossary.html#editor">editor</a>. When toggled on, the loop playlist toggle button causes the multi instrument to select a new playlist entry to play each time it finishes playing a playlist entry.</p>
<p><img alt="Loop Playlist Toggle Button" src="images/loopPlaylistToggleButton.png" /></p>
<p>The loop instrument button is found on most types of instruments. It appears in the deck when a <a href="glossary.html#single-instrument">single instrument</a> or <a href="glossary.html#programmer-instrument">programmer instrument</a> is selected in the editor, and also when a single instrument or programmer instrument is selected in the playlist of a multi instrument or <a href="glossary.html#scatterer-instrument">scatterer instrument</a>. When toggled on, the loop instrument button causes the selected single instrument or programmer instrument to play repeatedly instead of just once. If the loop instrument button is toggled on for only some of the entries in a playlist, only those entries will loop when they are selected for playback.</p>
<p><img alt="Loop Instrument Toggle Button" src="images/loopInstrumentToggleButton.png" /></p>
<p>Toggling on either kind of loop toggle button causes the adjacent play count number box to become active and editable.</p>
<p>The looping behavior of an instrument also depends on the instrument's <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#play-count">play count</span class="dead-link"> properties, whether the instrument is <a href="glossary.html#synchronous">synchronous</a> or <a href="glossary.html#asynchronous">asynchronous</a>, and whether it is untriggered while playing.</p>
<h3 id="play-count"><a href="#play-count">5.3.1 Play Count</a></h3>
<p>Play count is a property of instruments, playlists, and playlist entries. The exact effect of a play count property depends on whether it is associated with an instrument or playlist entry or with a playlist.</p>
<p>In the case of an instrument or playlist entry, play count is the maximum number of times the instrument or playlist entry can play when triggered or selected.</p>
<p>In the case of playlists, play count is the maximum number of times the playlist may select a new entry when the multi instrument is triggered.</p>
<p>If a loop instrument toggle button or loop playlist toggle button is toggled off, its associated play count number box is grayed out and inactive. In this state, the effective play count of the instrument, playlist entry or playlist is always one.</p>
<h3 id="synchronous-and-asynchronous-looping-instruments"><a href="#synchronous-and-asynchronous-looping-instruments">5.3.2 Synchronous and Asynchronous Looping Instruments</a></h3>
<p>Synchronous single instruments and synchronous programmer instruments display multiple copies of their associated waveforms on their trigger regions. The number of waveform graphics displayed is equal to the number of copies that fit on the trigger region, up to a maximum of the instrument's play count property.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="working-with-instruments.html#synchronous-and-asynchronous-instruments">Synchronous and Asynchronous Instruments</a> section of this chapter, synchronous instruments immediately fall silent and stop producing output when no longer overlapped by the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#timeline-parameter">timeline</span class="dead-link"> <a href="glossary.html#playback-position">playback position</a>. Synchronous instruments that are no longer overlapped by the playback position therefore fall silent immediately, even if they have not finished playing the number of times specified by their loop count properties.</p>
<p>Note that a <a href="glossary.html#loop-region">loop region</a>, <a href="glossary.html#transition-marker">transition marker</a>, or <a href="glossary.html#transition-region">transition region</a> that moves the playback position from one part of a synchronous instrument's trigger region to another untriggers and retriggers that instrument in the process.</p>
<p>When untriggered, asynchronous looping instruments whose <a href="glossary.html#cut-behavior">cut behavior</a> is "cut immediately" immediately stop producing output. Asynchronous looping instruments whose cut behavior is "Play to end" instead play out to completion as dictated by their play count properties. If the play count of a single instrument, a programmer instrument or the playlist of a multi instrument is infinite when untriggered, that play count will behave if it was 1, instead of infinite, for this purpose.</p>
<h3 id="instrument-properties-and-behavior"><a href="#instrument-properties-and-behavior">5.3.3 Instrument Properties and Behavior</a></h3>
<p>The combination of looping behavior, play count, cut behavior, and synchronousity/asynchronousity determines how an instrument behaves when untriggered, as summarized in the following table.</p>

<h2 id="fade-in-and-fade-out"><a href="#fade-in-and-fade-out">5.4 Fade In and Fade Out</a></h2>
<p>Each instrument placed on a track has a fade in and a fade out feature. This allows for smoothly starting or finishing an instrument's sound but behaves differently from an <a href="glossary.html#ahdsr-modulator">AHDSR modulator</a>.</p>
<p>To add a fade in or a fade out to an instrument, hover your mouse over the top left or right corner of the instrument. Once the mouse cursor changes to a curved arrow, click and drag to the desired position.</p>
<p><img alt="Fade In" src="images/fadeIn.png" /></p>
<p>You can click and drag on the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#shape-handle">shape handle</span class="dead-link"> to adjust the speed of the fading.</p>
<p>The position of the <a href="glossary.html#playback-position">playback position</a> on the fade curves determines the volume of the instrument at that time. If the playback position moves to a part of the instrument where a fade-in or fade-out appears, then the volume of the instrument will be the level shown by the fade in or fade out curves. This is the same behavior as if you were to use <a href="glossary.html#automation">automation</a> on the instruments volume.</p>
<p>By comparison, an <a href="glossary.html#ahdsr-modulator">AHDSR modulator</a> will only be applied when an instrument is triggered and released.</p>
<p>Instruments that have both a fade in or fade out and an AHDSR modulator will have both applied.</p>
<h2 id="cut-and-modulation"><a href="#cut-and-modulation">5.5 Cut and Modulation</a></h2>
<p>When an instrument is set to <a href="glossary.html#asynchronous">asynchronous</a> mode, you can also toggle the <a href="glossary.html#cut-behavior">cut</a> mode on or off. Using this in conjunction with <a href="glossary.html#ahdsr-modulator">AHDSR modulators</a> can affect how an instrument finishes playing once the <a href="glossary.html#playback-position">playback position</a> has left the <a href="glossary.html#trigger-region">trigger region</a>.</p>
<h3 id="cut"><a href="#cut">5.5.1 Cut</a></h3>
<p>Cut allows for an asynchronous instrument to become untriggered once the playback position has left the <a href="glossary.html#trigger-region">trigger region</a>. Unlike with synchronous instruments, when an asynchronous instrument becomes untriggered in this way it can then play out using an <a href="glossary.html#ahdsr-modulator">AHDSR Modulator</a>.</p>
<p>You can enable cut mode by clicking on the "Cut" button to the right of the "Async" button. Cut is not enabled by default. When cut mode is not enabled, the instrument will play its asset in its entirety once triggered.</p>
<p>If cut mode is enabled on the instrument, then the AHDSR modulation will completely override this behavior no matter which property it is applied to. Once the playback position leaves the trigger region, the instrument becomes untriggered and the release will be applied.</p>
<h3 id="ahdsr-modulation"><a href="#ahdsr-modulation">5.5.2 AHDSR Modulation</a></h3>
<p><span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#ahdsr-modulation">AHDSR (Attack, Hold, Sustain, Decay, Release) modulation</span class="dead-link"> is a type of envelope that gives you control over how a property of an event or instrument changes when the event or instrument starts, what its value is at its peak, and how it changes when the event or instrument is stopped or untriggered. For more information on how to use AHDSR modulation, please see the <a href="authoring-events.html#modulation">modulation</a> section of the <a href="authoring-events.html">authoring events</a> chapter.</p>
<p>On a synchronous instrument the AHDSR modulation will not apply the release when untriggered by the playback position leaving the trigger region. This is due to the fact that a synchronous instrument will stop playing once the playback position has left the trigger region but that is also the exact same time the release is applied. Release will only be applied on a synchronous instrument if the instrument's <a href="glossary.html#parameter-condition">parameter conditions</a> stop being true.</p>
<p>On an asynchronous instrument the AHDSR modulation will be applied in its entirety. When the playback position leaves the trigger region, the instrument will become untriggered and apply the release.</p>
<h2 id="delay-and-quantization"><a href="#delay-and-quantization">5.6 Delay And Quantization</a></h2>
<p>FMOD Studio allows you to set an instrument to delay playing back until a certain time, until a certain amount of time has elapsed, or playing back on certain musical beats. This can be time-based, beat-based, or both. This is useful if you need instruments to be played back only at or after certain times. For example, stingers in your dynamic background music that must keep with the tempo of the song, or random fire crackling for a camp fire sound effect.</p>
<h3 id="time"><a href="#time">5.6.1 Time</a></h3>
<p>The time property of the trigger behavior allows you to define the period of time that FMOD Studio counts before an <a href="glossary.html#instrument">instrument</a> begins to play. While an instrument is triggered the instant the <a href="glossary.html#playback-position">playback position</a> makes contact with its associated trigger region, it does not actually have to start playing the instrument at this point.</p>
<p>The delay &amp; quantization section of the <a href="glossary.html#trigger">trigger behavior</a> drawer has a "Time" button that, when enabled, displays the "Delay Interval" property that works via a ribbon slider. </p>
<p>The slider defines the minimum and maximum time values in milliseconds or seconds an instrument's <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#condition">conditions</span class="dead-link"> must continue to be met before it will trigger. If the instrument's trigger conditions are unmet before the minimum amount of time specified, it will not have a chance to trigger.</p>
<p>If both the min and max values are the same then a fixed delay is always applied to that instrument every time it is activated. If the min and max values are different then they create a window in time. FMOD Studio counts at least the minimum time value and no more than the maximum time value, but between those two it randomly selects a period of delay to apply to the instrument.</p>
<p><img alt="Delay and Quantization - Time" src="images/timeButton.png" /></p>
<p>You can define the values by either dragging the ends of the ribbon slider to the desired values, or double clicking on the displayed numbers to directly input exact values.</p>
<h3 id="tempo"><a href="#tempo">5.6.2 Tempo</a></h3>
<p>The delay &amp; quantization section of the trigger behavior drawer has a "Tempo" button that, when enabled, displays the "Quantization Interval" behavior for events that have <a href="glossary.html#tempo-marker">tempo markers</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Delay and Quantization - Tempo" src="images/tempoButton.png" /></p>
<p>When an event includes a tempo marker, FMOD Studio applies tempo tracking as well as counting regular time. Tempo quantization allows instruments to be delayed slightly so that they trigger in time with the defined tempo and as such sound more "musical".</p>
<p>You can switch to view <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#time-beats-display">beats</span class="dead-link"> in the timeline and the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#time-beats-display">time indicator</span class="dead-link"> by clicking on the "Beat" button on the time indicator section.</p>
<p>Once a tempo marker is added to an event, the ruler lines change to match the tempo measures in bar and beat format, when the timeline is set to display beats. Instrument trigger regions can be moved to align with these measures, but the quantization property ensures they trigger in sync with the musical measures.</p>
<p>The quantization property can be set to either bar values of 1 or 2, or beat values of minim, crotchet, dotted crotchet or quaver measures.</p>

<h2 id="trigger-conditions"><a href="#trigger-conditions">5.7 Trigger Conditions</a></h2>
<p>It is possible to set certain <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#trigger-behavior">trigger conditions</span class="dead-link"> for instruments. </p>
<p>By default, an instrument is triggered once the <a href="glossary.html#playback-position">playback position</a> has reached within the instrument's trigger region. You can add further conditions in the instrument's <a href="glossary.html#trigger">trigger behavior</a> drawer. Click on the disclosure triangle to the left of the instrument's panel in the <a href="glossary.html#deck">deck</a> to view these settings.</p>
<p>To add a parameter condition to an instrument, click the "Add Condition" button at the bottom of the conditions list and select the <a href="glossary.html#game-parameter">game parameter</a> you wish the instrument to be triggered by. This automatically adds the game parameter to the event if it is not already present. You can use each game parameter no more than once in each instrument's conditions list.</p>
<p>Only when <em>all</em> the conditions in the conditions list have been met and the playback position is withing the instruments <a href="glossary.html#trigger-region">trigger region</a> will the instrument start playing. In the same regard, the instrument will become untriggered when <em>any</em> of the conditions stop being met.</p>
<p>If there are any <a href="glossary.html#quantization">delay and quantization</a> settings in place, then the instrument won't start playing unless all conditions are met at the exact point the quantization point is reached. A quantized instrument will become untriggered immediately when a condition is not met anymore.</p>
<p>You can further customize the trigger conditions by enabling the <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#probability">randomization</span class="dead-link"> button (labeled with a dice). Changing the "Probability" dial in the probability conditions will give a percentage value for <em>if</em> the instrument will trigger. These probability calculations are called at the time that all conditions are met and won't be recalculated until the conditions have been unmet then remet.</p></div>
