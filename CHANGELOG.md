--Crockpot General Rules--

* [x]  Ice and twigs cannot be more than 1 inside crockpot recipes (With the exception of foods that REQUIRE ice AND twigs).

* [x]  Bacon and eggs has a lower cooking priority than monster lasagna. Prevents 50/50 game with monstermeat.

* [x]  Cooked Monstermeat has a value of 2.

* [x]  Monster Jerky has a value of 1, this means it can be used alone to make meatballs and pierogi. This does not go for monster morsel jerky though...

* [x]  Bug based ingredients have an "insectiod" value. Aside from specialty dishes, using two insectiod ingredients can make wet goop. Currently the only two insectiod ingredients are butterfly wings and scorpion carapaces.

* [x]  Monster morsels are added, they are typically not a good idea to use in the crockpot, but they do have some uses. Each form has a monster value 0.5 greater than monster meat.

* [x]  As one final note, most typical crockpot recipes are actually hardly changed by the monster meat changes, but recipes like meatballs and pierogi that use only one meat are the most affected.

* [x]  If you are confused by any recipes, Anomen put together some example recipes with monster meat here https://uncompromising-mode.fandom.com/wiki/Crock_Pot (Not that not every page on the wiki is up to date, the CHANGELOG.md is the most up to date compendium of info).
